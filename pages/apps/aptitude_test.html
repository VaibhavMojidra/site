					Aptitude Test with Answers is an app that help you to prepare yourself for Aptitude Test and
					Interview
					Preparation. Works on both iOS and Android
				</p>
				<p class="my_text">
					This app has been developed by Vaibhav Mojidra.
				</p>
				<p class="my_text">
					The app provides you with a variety of questions so you don't get bored with the same ones over and
					over. This functionality is entirely based on the random selection of questions.
				</p>
				<p class="my_text">
					Each test is divided into sections such as logical, mathematical, spatial, and verbal so that the
					user can prepare for the aptitude test as a whole.
				</p>
				<p class="my_text">
					This app has a bookmark option that allows you to save questions that you are unsure about or want
					to try again later during the test. This helps in time management, which is an important
					consideration during aptitude.
				</p>

					This app has a bookmark option that allows you to save questions that you are unsure about or want

					consideration during aptitude.
				</p>
				<p class="my_text">
					Mostly in the real-world, aptitude tests are usually timed. This app allows you to do the same with
					a time constraint so that you may prepare in a realistic environment.
				</p>
				<p class="my_text">
					The app enables individuals to try out different levels. Each level has its own time limit and
					passing criteria. This empowers the practitioner to prepare thoroughly and perform admirably.
				</p>
				<p class="my_text">
					Since the aptitude exam consists of questions and options that must be read and understood
					carefully, this may cause the practitioner's eyes to strain. Each individual can use the dark mode
					option throughout the app to reduce eye strain.
				</p>
				<p class="my_text">
					Our app provides detailed graphical and statistical results of each section, along with the
					aggregate score of each practitioner, so that each can know which aptitude section to focus on and
					improve.
				</p>
				<p class="my_text">
					Just giving an aptitude test isn't enough preparation. Practitioners need to know the correct
					answers and understand the reason behind them. Our app provides practitioners with thorough
					explanations for all of the questions they attempted in the test.
