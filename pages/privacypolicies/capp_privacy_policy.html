				<p class="my_text">
					I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page

					This policy is effective as of 2022-02-24

				<h4 class="my_text">Terms & Conditions</h4>
				<p class="my_text">
					By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
					therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify
					the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract
					the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or
					make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and
					other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Vaibhav Mojidra.
					<br>
					Vaibhav Mojidra is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
					that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
					time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very
					clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.<br>
					You should be aware that there are certain things that Vaibhav Mojidra will not take responsibility
					for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
					connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Vaibhav Mojidra cannot take
					responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and
					you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
					<br>
					If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the
					agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
					your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
					app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
					charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
					region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
					which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from
					the bill payer for using the app.
					<br>
					Along the same lines, Vaibhav Mojidra cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app
					i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t
					turn it on to avail the Service, Vaibhav Mojidra cannot accept responsibility.
					<br>
					With respect to Vaibhav Mojidra’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app,
					it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at
					all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available
					to you. Vaibhav Mojidra accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a
					result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
					<br>
					At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
					requirements for the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of
					the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
					Vaibhav Mojidra does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
					and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise
					to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing
					the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless
					we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
					terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
				</p>
				<h4 class="my_text">Contact Us</h4>
				<p class="my_text">
